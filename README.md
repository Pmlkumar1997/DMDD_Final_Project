The proposed “Cricket League Management” system is an online portal which is build with a goal of managing a whole cricket league from conducting auction to declaring the winner. Owners and players gets registered into the system and the system is available 24/7, so the owners can bid on the players from any place and anywhere which saves a lot of their time and money. Teams owners can use this system to track the budget/bidding amount/fee paid to the player, search for a particular player, monitor their team performance, get venue information, etc. Players can use this system to register and take part of the auction, keep track of their statistics, get information about venues, etc. The audience can access this system and book tickets the various matches in the league. Only authenticated owners/players can take part in the auction. The database keeps the information about the auction, player history, player/team statistics, venues, etc. The system has strong user authentication.
